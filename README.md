0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
This is the first part of a project for Holberton School: AirBnB clone - The console. First step: Write a command interpreter to manage the AirBnB objects.

The command interpreter
The command interpreter is currently capable of:

Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
Installation
git clone https://github.com/alejolo311/AirBnB_clone
cd AirBnB_clone
Usage
Interactive Mode

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
Non-Interactive Mode

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)

Command Snytax and Usage:
Command	Syntax	Output
help	help [option]	Displays all available commands
quit	quit	Exit command interpreter
EOF	EOF	Exit command interpreter
create	create [class_name] or [class_name].create()	Creates an instance of class_name
update	update [class_name] [object_id] [update_key] [update_value] or [class].update([object_id] [update_key] [update_value]()	Updates the key:value of class_name.object_id instance
show	show [class_name] [object_id] or [class_name].show([object_id])()	Displays all attributes of class_name.object_id
all	all [class_name], [class_name].all()	Displays every instance of class_name, if used without option displays every instance saved to the file
destroy	destroy [class_name] [object_id] or [class_name].destroy([object_id])()	Deletes all attributes of class_name.object_id
count	count [class_name] or [class_name].count()	Counts all the instances with class name specified
